# Double Jeopardy and Climate Impact in the Use of Large Language Models: Socio-economic Disparities and Reduced Utility for Non-English Speakers

This work investigates the socio-economic disparities and reduced utility for non-English speakers in the use of large language models (LLMs). We use the FLORES-200 dataset and Ethnologue to analyze the socio-economic disparities in the use of LLMs. We also use the OpenAI's GPT-4 API to assess the reduced utility of LLMsfor non-English speakers.
